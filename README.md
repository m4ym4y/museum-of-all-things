The goal of this project is to make an interactive 3d museum that is generated
procedurally, using content from wikipedia to fill exhibits. The museum is
virtually limitless, allowing you to take doors from one exhibit to another,
depending on what is linked from that wikipedia article.

The text of the article is also inserted as informative plaques on the wall, so you
can read about the exhibit while looking at the pictures from it. Images are also
pulled from wikimedia commons in the category corresponding to the article.

Every exhibit is filled with hallways to other exhibits, based on the links in the
current exhibit's wikipedia page. You'll never run out of things to explore!

## Contributing

If you encounter bugs in the museum, file them on the [issues
page.](https://github.com/m4ym4y/museum-of-all-things/issues) **Please include
the platform you're running on, and the name of the exhibit that the bug
occurred in.** (screenshots are also helpful)

You may file feature requests, but keep in mind that I'm a solo developer
distributing a free project. I'll prioritize whatever I have time for and feel
motivated to work on.

~~I do not currently have any policy for allowing outside contributors to the
codebase. I might change that in the future, particularly if I pursue
localization in other languages.~~

There are now many contributors to this project! Feel free to submit any pull
request and I will review it. I am more likely to accept PRs that are bugfixes or
optimizations/visual upgrades. As for things that affect the creative direction
of the museum I am still a bit precious about controlling that roadmap myself so
no guarantees that those types of changes will be merged. If you are unsure, file
an issue and we can discuss it before you put too much work in.
